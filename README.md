# Minesweeper Game
Remember that old Minesweeper game we used to play!
If you don't recall let me refresh your memory.
We play on a square board and we have to click on the cells which do not have a mine.
The player does not know where the mines are and if a cell where a mine is present is clicked then we lose and if we don't click on a mine, we can continue playing the game.
## Here is how you can download and run this on your computers.
